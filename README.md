# Welcome to my personal portfolio website repo!

![Preview of the current design draft](public/Portfolio_Preview.gif)

- I've now finished the initial implementation, and started the implementation.
- I'm currently testing and tweaking a responsive skeleton. Once I'm satisified with this, I'll start implementing the components for the different sections. 

## Design

- I'll be using a **bright, bold shade of green** as the primary color — it feels very *me*, and I find it both calming and empowering.
- I'll pair it with **light cream/off-white** and **olive green**.
- I'll use a dark gray colour for majority of the text, so it's easier on the eyes!
- I'm thinking of including **fern leaf patterns** into the design somewhere. 
- These color and design choices are inspired by **Scandinavian design**,
- I love the light, airy and minimal feel of many Scandivanian inspred coffee shops, and their shelves that have green plants!

## Tech Stack

- I've chosen to use **Astro**, **TypeScript**, and **TailwindCSS**
- I’m usingf **Figma** to help with prototyping the design, and **Canva** ŧo help create the vidoes

## Building in Public

As with my other projects, I’ll be **building in public on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vinaygajjar/)** — so keep an eye out for updates!

*(I’ve already posted about the color scheme!)*
